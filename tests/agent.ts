 * These two used to poke at `session.conversation` -- clearing it, or making a
 * second session and checking the first one's talk did not leak in. Neither is
 * `runAgent`'s rule any more. The conversation is stored per schematic and
 * restored when that file is opened, so *which* history applies is decided by
 * `services/conversation.ts` and tested against real files in tests/services.ts.
 *
 * What is left here is the contract this function actually has, and it is
 * sharper than what was being asserted before: it replays exactly the history
 * it is handed, and it returns the history the next turn should be handed. The
 * memory used to be invisible from the outside -- these had to infer it from
 * what the model was sent -- and now it is a value.
