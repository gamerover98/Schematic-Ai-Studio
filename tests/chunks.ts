/**
 * `pipeline/chunked_mesh.ts` — meshing only what changed.
 *
 * The property everything else rests on: **an incrementally updated mesh is
 * identical to one built from scratch.** A chunk cache that is merely
 * *plausible* renders a structure that looks right until the one chunk it
 * forgot, and there is no error to notice — so the suite compares bytes, over a
 * sequence of edits chosen to land on the awkward places: chunk interiors,
 * chunk boundaries, corners where three chunks meet, and a block removed rather
 * than added.
 *
 * The second property is that it actually saves the work it exists to save.
 * A cache that quietly rebuilds everything would pass every equality check
 * above and be worthless, so the number of chunks rebuilt is asserted too.
