/**
 * The renderer's pure modules.
 *
 * Svelte components cannot be exercised here -- there is no component runner in
 * this project, and adding one would be a bigger decision than any single
 * feature warrants. So the parts of the renderer worth testing are deliberately
 * written *outside* the components: `i18n_core.ts` holds the lookup and
 * interpolation while `i18n.svelte.ts` holds only the rune, and that split is
 * what makes this file possible.
 *
 * The centrepiece is not the interpolation tests -- those are arithmetic. It is
 * `every key used by the renderer exists`, which walks the actual source and
 * resolves every `t(...)`/`tn(...)` against the catalogue. A missing message
 * degrades to the key itself, which is visible but not loud, and would
 * otherwise reach a user before it reached anyone else.
