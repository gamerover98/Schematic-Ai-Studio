/**
 * Sandbox containment checks for the QuickJS/WASM engine (RULEBOOK.md §3 as
 * amended by DEV-015).
 *
 * The engine behind `executeJsBuild` was swapped from isolated-vm to
 * quickjs-emscripten because isolated-vm cannot be loaded in Electron at all.
 * §3's guarantees are properties of *an* engine, not of that specific one, so
 * they have to be re-demonstrated against the replacement rather than assumed
 * to carry over. This file is that demonstration.
 *
 * Every check below is a claim §3 makes:
 *   - no ambient authority reaches the guest (no require/process/fs/network)
 *   - the deadline is enforced, and surfaces as a SandboxViolationError
 *   - bad generated code surfaces as a GeneratedCodeError, NOT as a violation
 *   - coordinate values crossing the bridge are rejected, never coerced to NaN
 *   - the host is not reachable through the bridge's own arguments
