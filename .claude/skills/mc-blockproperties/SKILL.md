description: Look up what a Minecraft block state property *means* — what it controls, and when its meaning or its type changed between versions — and vendor the prose into this app's generated reference. Use when `describe_block` answers `description: null`, when the generator reports an undescribed property/value combination, when a description reads wrong, or when `resources/block_properties.json` needs refreshing after the block registry moves.

# Saying what a block state is *for*

`mc-blockstates` vendors the game's own registry: which properties a block has,
what values they take, and what state it is born in. That is enough to validate
an edit and enough to fill a dropdown.

It is not enough to **choose**. `signal_fire` and `lit` are both booleans on a
campfire, and nothing in the registry says one makes a tall column of smoke and
the other decides whether the fire is burning at all. `half` is `top|bottom` on
a staircase and `upper|lower` on a door, and those are not the same question
asked twice — one is which half of a cell the block occupies, the other is which
of two blocks this one is.

This skill vendors the sentence. `describe_block` in `src/main/agent/tools.ts`
serves it to whichever model is driving the app, which is the whole reason it
has to be right: a plausible sentence about a property is acted on.

## The shape of it

```
resources/block_properties.json    the prose, with provenance   ← you edit this
scripts/gen-block-properties.mjs   JSON -> the table            ← you run this
src/shared/block_properties.ts     the table, plus the lookups
```

The generator replaces only the rows between two markers. The lookups above and
below them, and the prose explaining what is *not* decided there, are
hand-written and must stay that way. Same arrangement as `mc_versions.json` and
`block_states.json`, for the same reason.

## Keyed by property and value set, not by block

1197 blocks carry 93 distinct property names between them, in **121 distinct
forms**. The key is the pair — the name, and the exact set of values.

Keyed by block, `facing` would be described 335 times and the 335 copies would
drift. Keyed by name alone, a fence and a wall would have to share one sentence
about `north` while the game gives them different **types**.

That second one is not hypothetical, and it is the reason the key is what it is:

> **A wall's `north` is `none|low|tall`; a fence's is `true|false`.** Code that
> tests `properties.north === "true"` does not fail on a 1.16+ wall — it
> silently reads every connection as absent. `block_shapes.ts` has a `wall()`
> that knows this and a `fence()` that deliberately does not.

13 of the 93 properties appear in more than one form. They are the 13 that
matter.

## How this skill's trust rule differs from both its siblings

| skill | what buys trust | why |
|---|---|---|
| `mc-versions` | **two independent sources that agree** | a transposed DataVersion is undetectable by any local check |
| `mc-blockstates` | **the data is the game's own, and the tripwire is mechanical** | a wrong property name fails a suite |
| `mc-blockproperties` | **corroboration** | a wrong *sentence* fails nothing, anywhere, ever |

This is the `mc-versions` rule arrived at from the other direction. A wrong
description is invisible to every check this repo could ever run: the file
saves, the block is placed, the picture is right, and a model reads the sentence
and builds the wrong thing on the strength of it.

So: **do not write a description from memory.** Look it up, and where the claim
is about behaviour rather than about a name, corroborate it. Where two sources
disagree, report both and change nothing — unless the game's own data settles
it, which happens more here than it does for versions (see below).

What is *not* on you to establish: the values and the defaults. Those come from
`block_states.json`, and the generator refuses a row naming a combination the
registry does not have.

## The sources

| source | what it gives | independence |
|---|---|---|
| `minecraft.wiki/w/Block_states` | the canonical table: every property, its values, a one-sentence description | a human transcription |
| `minecraft.wiki/w/<Block>` | the per-block **Block states** table and the **History** section | the same wiki, but written and edited separately |
| `resources/block_states.json` | the values and the defaults, from the game jar | the game itself |

The third one is a genuine arbiter and should be used as one. A worked example
from this file's first pass:

> `minecraft.wiki/w/Block_states` says the sign and banner `rotation` default
> changed from 0 to 8 in **26.1 (snapshot 11)**. `minecraft.wiki/w/Sign` says
> the default "has consistently been 0". The vendored registry, pinned at 26.2,
> says **`"rotation": "8"`** — so the Block_states page is right and the Sign
> page's History section is stale. Both are recorded in the row's `versions`
> note, because the next person to check will find the same contradiction.

## Version drift is the substance, not a footnote

This app writes schematics for 1.8 onward, so a property's history is part of
its meaning. The changes worth recording are the ones that *look like* nothing:

- **A type change wearing the costume of a value change.** Walls, 1.16
  (20w06a): `north`/`east`/`south`/`west` went from `true|false` to
  `none|low|tall`. Nothing breaks loudly.
- **A default moving.** Sign and banner `rotation`, 26.1: 0 to 8. A file written
  before and after that release describes two different-looking builds from the
  same prose.
- **A property that used to be a different block.** Before 1.13 a lit block was
  a separate id — furnace 61 against lit furnace 62 — so `lit` does not exist in
  a pre-Flattening file at all. `legacy_blocks.json` turns the numeric pair into
  `lit=true` on the way in.

Record the version as the wiki names it, and say what the change *costs* rather
than only that it happened. A note that reads "changed in 1.16" tells the next
reader nothing they can act on.

## What reads this downstream, and why it matters most here

`describe_block` over MCP puts the `description` of each property in front of a
model that is about to place a block. Derived, so a new property arrives there
on its own -- and that is exactly what makes this file the most dangerous of
the seven.

The trust rule above already says the substance here is **prose**, which fails
no check anywhere: the file saves, the block is placed, the picture is right.
What is new is that the sentence is no longer read only by whoever opens the
inspector. It is read by something that then builds on it, in a session nobody
is watching, and a wrong sentence becomes a wrong structure with every
mechanical check green.

So the verification step is to *read the answer*: call `describe_block` on the
properties this pass touched and check the sentences say what the game does.

## Doing it

1. **Read `resources/block_properties.json`** to see what is described and when
   it was last checked.

2. **Find out what is missing.**

   ```bash
   node scripts/gen-block-properties.mjs
   ```

   Its stderr reports every property/value combination the registry has and
   this file does not, with a block count and an example. That list is the work.

3. **Look up a short list at a time.** Start from
   `minecraft.wiki/w/Block_states`, which has the canonical one-line
   description, then open the block's own page for anything about *behaviour* or
   *history*.

   **A short list, deliberately.** A model asked to summarise a 121-row table
   paraphrases, and a paraphrase is exactly where `none|low|tall` quietly
   becomes `true|false`.

4. **Write the row.** `values` copied from `block_states.json` — not retyped —
   `description` in one or two sentences, `versions` only where there is a real
   source, and `sources` only for a page beyond the ones in `_source`.

5. **Regenerate, and read the two halves of what it says.**

   ```bash
   node scripts/gen-block-properties.mjs
   ```

   - A row naming a combination the registry does not have **fails the build**.
     Do not widen the check: the row describes something that is not in the
     game, or the registry has moved under it — a rename, or a type change.
   - A combination with no row is reported and nothing more.
     `describe_block` answers `description: null`, which is honest.

6. **Check.**

   ```bash
   npx tsx tests/blocks.ts
   ```

   That suite states the cross-check from both sides, and states the fence/wall
   distinction by name.

7. **Show the user what changed**, by property, before treating it as settled.

## Notes worth having

- **Running with nothing new must change no bytes.** The generator prints
  "already matches" and exits. If it rewrites the file every run, the ordering
  or the formatting has drifted, and that is the bug rather than the diff.
- **A description is not a defaults claim.** `describe_block` gets the default
  from the registry, and `waterlogged` deliberately has none — it is legal on
  hundreds of blocks and is not part of what a placed one is born with. Do not
  write "defaults to false" into a description; it would contradict the
  `placedAs` string in the same answer.
- **Describe the property, not the block.** `facing` on a staircase and `facing`
  on a wall torch differ in which direction counts as the front, and that
  belongs in the sentence as a named exception — not as a second row, because
  the value set is identical and the generator would refuse it as a duplicate of
  a combination already described.
- **Say what a value means where the name does not.** `tip_merge`,
  `single_wall`, `ascending_east` and `inner_left` are opaque; `true` and
  `false` are not.
- **A property that is only ever set by the game is worth saying so about.**
  `instrument` is derived from the block under a note block, and a model told
  that will stop trying to set it.
