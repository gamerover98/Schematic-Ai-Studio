 * the second half of the empty-space button's bug: the sources were right and
 * the set they were looked up in could never contain the commonest one.
 *
 * Air is recovered rather than transported: `countBlocks` counts every voxel
 * whose palette index is not zero, and index 0 is always air, so the document
 * holds air exactly when `blockCount` is short of the volume. Exact, and out of
 * two numbers `DocumentState` already carries.
 *
 * ## Both spellings, because `voidSources` speaks the other one
 *
 * A palette entry is a full state string -- `minecraft:water[level=0]` -- while
 * a source may be either: the modal's presets are bare and a block somebody
 * typed may not be. Keeping only the bare name made a stated source
 * unmatchable, so the Replace button went dead over an edit that would have
 * worked; keeping only the full key made a bare source unmatchable, which is
 * every preset.
 *
 * Holding both is exactly `matchesBlockPattern`'s rule expressed as a set: a
 * bare source finds the block whatever state it is in, and a stated one finds
 * only that state. The two answers cannot drift apart, because a caller with a
 * source in hand does one `has`.
