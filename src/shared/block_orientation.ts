/**
 * Which way a placed block ends up pointing.
 *
 * Every block placed by hand until now landed in its default state, which for
 * anything with a direction is a lie the file then carries: a staircase always
 * `facing=north`, a log always `axis=y`, a slab always `bottom`. Building a
 * roof meant placing the stairs and then editing four properties by hand, and
 * building a floor of them meant doing it once per block.
 *
 * The game answers this from two things — where the player is looking, and
 * which face of which block they clicked — and so does this. It is the same
 * rule, transcribed; the point is not to invent a placement policy but to
 * reproduce the one whose muscle memory everyone already has.
 *
 * **This lives in `shared/` because it is a fact about Minecraft, not about a
 * process.** The renderer applies it at the moment of the click, which is the
 * only place the look direction exists; main needs the same answer the day the
 * agent is allowed to place a block the way a person does. Two tables would be
 * two tables to get wrong.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * Only families this file can state with confidence appear below. A block that
 * is not named keeps its default state, which is exactly what happened before —
 * so an omission costs nothing, while a wrong guess writes a block state that
 * is *worse* than the default because it looks deliberate. `observer` and
 * `anvil` are the two that were left out for that reason, not overlooked.
 *
 * Stairs' `shape` is also absent, and that one is structural: a corner is
 * decided by what the *neighbours* are, which is a question about the document
 * and not about the click. It belongs to whoever holds the voxels.

 *
 * ## It used to be a table here, and being hand-written was the fault
 *
 * Twenty-one families, keyed by suffix, against the two hundred-odd blocks that
 * carry properties at all. Everything else was placed bare, which is one cause
 * with two symptoms: an empty inspector, and -- for anything `block_shapes.ts`
 * reads a property to draw -- the wrong shape. A fence had no `north`, so it
 * drew as a bare post, and the panel that exists to fix that had nothing in it.
 *
 * `shared/block_states.ts` is generated from the game's own data, so the list
 * cannot drift from the set of blocks the app offers. What stayed hand-written
 * is everything above this line: `orientPlacement` asks where the camera was,
 * and no dataset knows that.
