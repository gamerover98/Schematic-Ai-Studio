   * **The *index* is the state, not the table, and that is load-bearing.**
   * This began as `$state` holding the raw table with a `$derived` inverting
   * it, and that shape froze the app. Two things were wrong with it and only
   * one is obvious:
   *
   * - plain `$state` on an object is a *deep* proxy, so a 1,682-key lookup
   *   table became a signal per entry;
   * - `buildLegacyIndex` returns fresh `Map`s and a fresh `Set` every time it
   *   runs, and consumers compare those **by identity** -- `placeable` is a
   *   prop. So the pickers re-filtered, the keyed `{#each}` rebuilt, and the
   *   update ran again. Svelte aborts a loop like that, and it takes every
   *   effect in the window with it.
   *
   * The viewport went on drawing throughout, because its render loop is a
   * `requestAnimationFrame` chain that owes Svelte nothing -- so the app was
   * *navigable and completely dead*, which is exactly how it was reported.
   *
   * Building it at the fetch removes the class rather than making it unlikely:
   * one assignment, one object, and `.names` is the same `Set` forever. It only
   * ever bit a legacy document, because everywhere this is read `docEra` is
   * tested first and `&&` short-circuits.
