  /**
   * What empty space is made of.
   *
   * A schematic has always been full of air, and for an underwater build that
   * is wrong in a way that only shows up after the paste: breaking a block
   * leaves a bubble, because the file says the cell is empty and the game
   * believes it.
   *
   * Choosing a block here does three things, and they are three mechanisms
   * rather than three settings:
   *
   * - it is **written** when a block is broken, so the file is right;
   * - it is **drawn** over every empty cell at the opacity below, so the space
   *     is visible as space;
   * - it is **ignored by the pointer**, so a click reaches whatever is behind
   *     it -- which is the only thing that makes editing inside it bearable.
   *
   * The last of those has a consequence worth reading before it is met: with
   * water chosen, water placed by hand is unpickable too. There is no way to
   * have both, and this is the half that was asked for.
   *
   * **The choice belongs to the schematic, not to the app.** It used to be a
   * global setting, which meant it followed you from an underwater build to
   * a cathedral quietly changing what a break wrote into the file. It is now
   * remembered per path, beside the version and the container.
