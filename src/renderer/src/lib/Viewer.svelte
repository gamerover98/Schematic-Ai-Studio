   * The base64-blob module loader that file opens with (createModuleUrl,

   * import, so the vendored copies under `app/viewer/lib/` are dropped too
   * (ARCHITECTURE.md §3 "Renderer Three.js").
   *
   * Everything below the imports is the original's behavior: same camera
   * (60° FOV, near 0.1), same OrbitControls damping and mouse mapping
   * (left=pan, middle=dolly, right=rotate), same hemisphere+directional
   * lighting with the AO-dependent intensities, same 256/32 grid at y=-0.01
   * with depthWrite off, same 1.6·maxDim framing, same R-to-reset.
