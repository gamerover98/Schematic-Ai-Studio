  /**
   * What the viewport says when nothing is open.
   *
   * It used to say nothing. The canvas mounted, drew its floor grid, and every
   * gesture landed on a document that was not there — the build grid is gated
   * on `documentSize`, so a click was not refused, it simply had no target and
   * nothing on screen explained why. The two things that would have fixed it,
   * New and Open, were one click away inside a sidebar tab that is not the
   * default one.
   *
   * Here rather than inside `Viewer.svelte`, and that is not arbitrary: the
   * viewer receives geometry and has no business knowing what a recent document
   * is. It is a sibling laid over the same canvas.
   *
   * It also names the other way in. With nothing open, a message typed into the
   * chat goes to the *generator* and builds the schematic the rest of the
   * conversation then edits — a real capability that is completely invisible
   * until someone tries it by accident.
   *
   * It blocks the window while it is up, which it did not: it was a card over a
   * live viewport, with the camera buttons, the gear and the whole sidebar
   * still taking clicks on a document that was not there. Blocking is why it
   * also has to be *dismissable* — the generator is reached by typing into the
   * chat with nothing open, so a screen that covered the chat and could not be
   * put away would not be polish, it would delete the feature it advertises.
