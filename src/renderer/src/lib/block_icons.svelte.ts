/**
 * Blocks drawn as blocks, once, for whoever needs the picture.
 *
 * The hotbar and the inventory both show blocks, and they used to show them
 * differently: the inventory rendered geometry from main, the hotbar drew a
 * hashed colour swatch. Two answers to "what does gravel look like", and only
 * one of them was the truth.
 *
 * ## One renderer for the whole window
 *
 * A `WebGLRenderer` per tile exhausts the browser's context limit at around
 * sixteen and then silently loses the oldest, so there is exactly one, drawn
 * off-screen, and each block is rendered into it once and kept as a `data:`
 * URL — which the CSP permits (`img-src 'self' data:`) and `blob:` it does not.
 * `preserveDrawingBuffer` is on for that read: without it the buffer may be
 * cleared before `toDataURL` sees it, and icons come out transparent on some
 * drivers and not others.
 *
 * It is a module rather than a component because two components need it at once
 * and the context limit is per window, not per component.
 *
 * ## Why they came out dull, and why they came out wrong
 *
 * Two separate faults, both fixed here and both worth naming.
 *
 * **Dull:** the atlas texture was uploaded without `SRGBColorSpace`, which the
 * viewport sets. The same pixels therefore drew darker and flatter in the
 * inventory than in the scene they were previews of.
 *
 * **Wrong on first open, right after scrolling:** the atlas was growing under
 * the icons. The baker decodes a texture the first time a block asks for it and
 * the atlas version *is* the texture count, so a batch of sixty came back as
 * sixty geometries each addressing a different layout, with one atlas to draw
 * them all. Fifty-nine were wrong, and scrolling looked like a cure only
 * because by then everything had been decoded and the count had stopped moving.
 *
 * Main settles the atlas per batch now, which fixes any one batch. The rest is
 * here: nothing is drawn until `warmBlockIcons` has meshed the whole block list
 * once, because an atlas that is still growing invalidates every icon already
 * drawn — visible as the grid blanking and refilling as it is scrolled. After
 * the warm-up main holds every block's geometry and a request is a cache hit.
 *
 * Requests are also serialised, one queue: overlapping ones each built their
 * result from the `painted` map as they found it and then replaced the whole
 * map, so a slower response erased a faster one's work.
 *
 * ## Shading, because an unlit cube is a coloured square
 *
 * Lambert lighting left every face of a stairs block reading as one flat shape.
 * The game does not light its inventory either — it shades each face by which
 * way it points, and that is what makes a cube look like a cube. The factors
 * below are the vanilla ones, baked into a vertex-colour attribute and
 * multiplied into an unlit material, so the texture's own colours survive
 * exactly.
