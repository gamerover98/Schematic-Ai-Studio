  /**
   * A searchable block field, replacing a bare text input with the actual
   * registry — the same `block_id_list.txt` set the agent is judged against
   * (CLAUDE.md: "the set the model is told about cannot drift from the set it
   * is judged against"). Typing anything the list does not contain is still
   * allowed; this only makes the common case a click instead of a memory test.
   *
   * Every match is *found*. The registry is ~1200 blocks, so an earlier cap of
   * 40 meant the list silently stopped a third of the way through the As — and
   * worse, a search that genuinely had 41 answers quietly showed 40 with nothing
   * to say it had. A dropdown that hides matches is harder to trust than a plain
   * text field, which was the thing this replaced.
   *
   * `ROW_LIMIT` is not that cap coming back, and the difference is the whole of
   * why it is allowed. It bounds how many rows *exist in the DOM*, and the line
   * above the list says both numbers out loud — so nothing is hidden silently,
   * which is the property the paragraph above is actually about.
   *
   * It exists because mounting one row per match is unbounded work on every
   * keystroke: `e` matches 974 of the 1197 ids, which is some five thousand DOM
   * nodes built and thrown away per character, inside a floating panel a few
   * rows tall. That is what the freeze was made of.
