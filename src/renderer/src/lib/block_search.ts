/**
 * Searching the block registry.
 *
 * A plain module rather than logic inside `BlockPicker.svelte` so it can be
 * tested: the picker is the only place in the app where the user meets all ~920
 * blocks, and the two things that make it usable — that it hides nothing, and
 * that the obvious answer is near the top — are both easy to break by accident
 * and invisible when broken. `tests/blocks.ts` holds them.

/**
 * How well a block id answers a query. Lower is better; -1 is no match.
 *
 * Ranked rather than left alphabetical because at this size alphabetical buries
 * the answer. "oak" has 41 matches and `dark_oak_*` sorts ahead of every
 * `oak_*`; "stone" has 76 and `minecraft:stone` itself lands after
 * `blackstone`, `blue_ice`-adjacent names and the rest of the Bs.
 *
 * **Nothing is matched against the namespace, and that used to be the last
 * line of this function.** Every block here is `minecraft:something`, so
 * falling back to the namespaced id meant every letter of `minecraft:` matched
 * the entire registry: `m`, `i`, `n`, `e`, `c`, `r`, `a`, `f`, `t` and every
 * substring of them. Measured on the shipped list -- 1197 ids, and `a`, `m`,
 * `e`, `c`, `r` and `t` each returned all 1197. `mi` returned 1197 to show the
 * **one** block whose name contains it.
 *
 * That is a bad search on its own, and it was also the load behind a total
 * freeze: the picker mounts one row per match, so nine of the commonest
 * letters in English each mounted some five thousand DOM nodes, per keystroke,
 * inside a floating panel a few rows tall.
 *
 * A query *is* allowed to carry the namespace -- pasting `minecraft:sto` has
 * to work -- so it is stripped from the query rather than matched in the id.
