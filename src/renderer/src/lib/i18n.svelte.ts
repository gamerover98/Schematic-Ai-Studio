/**
 * The current locale, and the `t()` every component calls.
 *
 * **The `.svelte.ts` extension is load-bearing.** `locale` below is a `$state`
 * rune, and runes are only compiled inside `.svelte` and `.svelte.js/ts`
 * modules. In a plain `.ts` this file would typecheck cleanly and then throw
 * `rune_outside_svelte` the moment it was imported -- and `svelte-check` would
 * not say a word, because as far as TypeScript is concerned nothing is wrong.
 * `bridge.svelte.ts` carries the same warning for the same reason.
 *
 * Holding the locale in module-level `$state` is what makes translation live:
 * `t()` reads it, components call `t()` while rendering, so every string in the
 * window is downstream of one variable. Changing the language re-renders the
 * app rather than requiring a reload.
 *
 * The lookup and interpolation themselves are in `i18n_core.ts`, which has no
 * runes and can therefore be tested.
