 * checking. It is four states and a colour, which sounds too small to be worth
 * separating — until you notice that the interesting case is the one where the
 * checkbox and the server disagree, and that a component test could not reach
 * it at all.
 *
 * ## The checkbox is intent; this is reality
 *
 * `settings.mcp.enabled` is what the user asked for. `McpStatus` is what main
 * observed. They come apart whenever starting fails — a second copy of the app
 * holding the port is the case that actually happens — and a dot derived from
 * the checkbox would then be green over a server that is not listening. That is
 * the specific failure this split exists to prevent, so the status is the only
