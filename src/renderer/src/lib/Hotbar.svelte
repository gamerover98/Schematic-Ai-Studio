  /**
   * Nine blocks along the bottom, in creative.
   *
   * The block to place used to be a text field with a dropdown — right for a
   * form, wrong for building, where the whole point is that changing material
   * costs no attention. Keys 1–9 pick a slot and the wheel steps through them,
   * which is what anyone who has played the game will try first.
   *
   * ## The wheel is already the zoom, and has to be taken
   *
   * `OrbitControls` maps it, so this listens with `capture` and calls
   * `preventDefault` — the same problem the left mouse button poses for
   * selection drags, and the same remedy. Only in flight (`ownsWheel`): in
   * orbit the wheel is the zoom, and the bar is on screen there too now, so
   * "there is no hotbar to step through" has stopped being the reason. The
   * reason is that the game has no zoom to lose and this does.
   *
   * ## Only what it is told
   *
   * The slot and the contents are props, and every change goes out through
   * `onchange`. They live in `UiSettings`, so the component holding its own copy
   * would mean two answers to "what am I holding" — and the one on screen would
   * be the one that failed to persist.
