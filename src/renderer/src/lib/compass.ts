/**
 * The corner gizmo: which way is north, and getting the camera to look from it.
 *
 * A viewport that can be orbited freely has no other answer to "which way am I
 * facing", and in an app whose whole subject is a world with named directions
 * that is a question asked constantly -- `facing=north` is written into the
 * file, and it is not derivable from the screen.
 *
 * A plain module for `build_grid.ts`'s and `framing.ts`'s reason. All of this
 * is consulted from `requestAnimationFrame`, which this project's browser
 * harness does not run: the decision lives here where a check can state it, and
 * only the trigger stays unobservable.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * Any three.js. The gizmo is drawn with three, in the viewer, and none of the
 * arithmetic below needs it -- rotating a vector by a quaternion is six lines,
 * and `tests/ui.ts` importing a renderer would buy nothing.
