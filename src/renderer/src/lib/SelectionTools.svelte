  <!--
    Cut, copy, paste, move, turn and mirror used to be nine buttons here.

    They are handles on the gizmo in the viewport now, which is where the
    thing they act on actually is -- a button that turns a region you are
    looking at somewhere else is a worse version of grabbing it. What stays
    is what has no handle to hang on: the block operations, and the three
    that are about the selection rather than about its contents.

    The keyboard kept all of them: Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+V and Delete are in
    `App.svelte`, and the command palette lists the rest.
