 * locale in a `$state` rune, which means it can only be compiled inside Svelte
 * and only be *run* by Svelte -- `tsx` cannot import it, so anything living
 * there is untestable. Everything here is a plain function over a plain object
 * and `tests/ui.ts` exercises it directly.
 *
 * There is no i18n library behind this. One locale, a flat map of dotted keys,
 * and `{name}` placeholders is the whole requirement, and a dependency that
 * brings ICU message syntax, a loader and a plural-rules table would be paying
 * for six features to use one.
