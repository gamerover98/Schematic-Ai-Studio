   * Before this, the file's name, its size and — the one that matters — whether
   * it had unsaved changes were shown *only* inside the sidebar's second tab:
   * the app could tell you that you had unpaid work, but only if you were
   * looking away from the thing you were building.
   *
   * The app's own name gave up the spot and moved to the window title, which is
   * where a desktop app puts it and where it can carry the file name too.
   *
   * Undo and Redo are here rather than in the menu with an accelerator, because
   * the menu deliberately does not claim Ctrl+Z — see `menu_model.ts`. These
   * buttons and the keyboard handler are the two ways to reach them.
