  /**
   * "● MCP · listening" in the status bar.
   *
   * It exists because letting somebody else's model edit your build is only
   * reasonable if you can see that it can. The dot answers one question — can
   * something outside this window change what I am looking at, right now — and
   * the three things it gets right are all about not lying:
   *
   * - **It reads main's status, never the checkbox.** Those come apart when a
   *   port is already taken, and a dot derived from the setting would be green
   *   over a server that never started. `mcp_status.ts` holds that rule.
   * - **It is a button.** It opens Settings on the MCP pane. A status light with
   *   no way to act on what it reports is the same half-feature as a floating
   *   panel with no way back.
   * - **Never colour alone.** The word is beside the dot, the title says the
   *   state in words, and a client actually using the server is distinguished
   *   by *motion* as well as by hue.
