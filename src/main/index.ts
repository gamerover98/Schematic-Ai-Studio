/**
 * Electron entry point. Replaces `run_app.py` (`st.set_page_config` + a render

 *
 * ARCHITECTURE.md §2 rule R-1: the renderer runs with `nodeIntegration: false`,
 * `contextIsolation: true`, `sandbox: true`. This app executes LLM-authored
 * JavaScript; the isolate that runs it lives in the main process behind
 * `core.ts`, and the renderer has no reason to hold a single Node primitive.
