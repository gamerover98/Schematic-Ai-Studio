 * derivable and `fence` above is right. `bamboo_fence` parents
 * `block/custom_fence_post` and the four `custom_fence_side_<dir>` models
 * instead, and those carry a **sheet**: `bamboo_fence.png` is one texture with
 * the post's flank, the post's lid, the rail's long side, the rail's end cap
 * and the rail's lid each in their own patch of it.
 *
 * So the derived window sampled the wrong part of the sheet, and measurably so:
 * the post's four flanks want `u 0..4, v 0..16`, which is **100% opaque**,
 * and were reading `u 6..10, v 0..16`, which is **40.6%** -- a post six tenths
 * made of holes. Its lid wants `[4, 0, 8, 4]`, 100%, and was reading 25%. That
 * is the lantern's fault on a block that looked like it had none, because a
 * fence post full of gaps still reads as a fence.
 *
 * The geometry differs too, by three units nobody would report: a custom
 * fence's rails run to `z = 9`, three deep inside the post, where an ordinary
 * fence's stop at `z = 7`. Vanilla states them that way and omits the face
 * that ends up buried, which is what `omit` carries here.
 *
 * **The four side models are transcribed one at a time rather than turned**,
 * and that is a finding rather than laziness. They are hand-authored in
 * vanilla and are *not* y-rotations of one another: north's end cap is stated
 * `rotation: 180` where east's and south's have none, and west's is written
 * `[15, 4, 13, 7]`, reversed, which is a mirror. On this pack's sheet that
 * cap patch differs from its own half-turn in **72 of 96 texels** and from its
 * own mirror in the same 72, so the three spellings are three different

/**
 * Candles, and the reason they were **invisible** rather than merely wrong.
 *
 * The shape was one box with no windows, so its UVs came from its own
 * coordinates: `x 7..9` of the tile. Decoded from the bundled pack,
 * `candle.png`'s opaque art lives at `x 0..1`, `y 5..15` -- so every face was
 * drawn, textured with nothing, and the block did not appear at all. This is
 * the sheet-of-parts case the header already names for the lantern and the
 * chain, arriving as a block that could not be seen.
 *
 * The vanilla windows say the same thing outright: a candle's sides are
 * `[0, 8, 2, 8 + height]` whatever the box is doing.
 *
 * The little cross on top is the wick, or the flame when it is lit. Two quads
 * of no thickness at +/-45 degrees -- so their four side faces have no area
 * and are not drawn, which is the rule this file already keeps for a chain.
 * Its position is derived from the stick because in all eight of vanilla's
 * candles it is exactly the stick's centre; that regularity is stated here
 * rather than transcribed eight times.
 *
 * `lit` swaps the **texture**, not the geometry, and that really is all
 * vanilla does: `candle_one_candle_lit.json` is this same template with
 * `all: block/candle_lit`, and the two textures differ by eighty pixels --
 * the wax at the top going from cream to white. Decoded from the bundled
 * pack, not assumed. `resolveBoxTexture` falls back to the block's own
 * texture for a pack shipping no `_lit`, so a candle is never worse off
 * than it was.
 *
 * ## The flame is an approximation, and is the only one in this file
 *
 * **No vanilla model has a candle flame.** In the game it is a particle,
 * spawned by the block, and this app draws no particles -- so a lit candle
 * was faithful to every model and still looked unlit, which is how it was
 * reported.
 *
 * So this crosses the line the header draws, deliberately and once: two
 * quads of `particle/flame`, the sprite the game's own particle uses. The
 * precedent is redstone and the skulls, where a cube was the *harmful*
 * answer; here nothing was harmful and the block was merely incomplete,
 * which is a weaker argument and worth saying out loud.
 *
 * **Its size is ours**, because no source states one: two units wide, which
 * is the candle's own width, and three tall, sitting directly on the wick.
 * The tallest candle in any group stands at 6, so the flame reaches 10 and
 * stays inside the cell in all four arrangements.
 *
 * It is lit from the inside by `lighting.ts`, which gives a lit candle the
 * game's own `3 per candle`. Without that the flame would be drawn at
 * whatever the room's light is, which in a sealed room is a dark smudge --
 * the same reason a campfire's fire is visible.

/**
 * A lever: a cobblestone base and a handle tilted 45 degrees off it, from
 * `lever.json` and `lever_on.json`.
 *
 * It was `againstWall(e, 3)` -- the ladder's shape with a thickness -- which is
 * a 16x16x3 plate covering a whole face of the cell, and that is three faults
 * rather than one:
 *
 * - the silhouette is a plate where the block is a switch;
 * - **`face` was not read at all**, so a lever on the floor or on the ceiling
 *   was drawn flat against a wall;
 * - a plate lying exactly on the cell boundary makes `coversFace` answer true,
 *   so a lever **deleted the face of the block it was screwed to**.
 *
 * ## Eight positions became twelve, and that is the era's doing
 *
 * 1.8 to 1.12.2 spelled the lever's position *and* its direction as one
 * metadata nibble, and `legacy_blocks.json` still holds it: `0` is the ceiling
 * facing north, `1..4` are the four walls, `5` and `6` are the floor facing
 * east and north, `7` is the ceiling facing east, and `+8` is powered. So the
 * pre-Flattening block has **eight** positions where the flat one has twelve:
 * a lever on the floor or on the ceiling could only lie north-south or
 * east-west, and `south` and `west` there are what 1.13 added.
 *
 * All sixteen values already map onto `face`, `facing` and `powered`, so a
 * 1.12 schematic arrives here with all three set. Only the drawing was ever
 * wrong, and it was wrong in both eras for the same reason.
 *
 * ## The two elements
 *
 * A 6x3x8 cobblestone base at `[5, -0.02, 4]`..`[11, 2.98, 12]` -- the two
 * hundredths are vanilla's own, holding the base off the surface it sits on --
 * and a 2x10x2 handle at `[7, 1, 7]`..`[9, 11, 9]`, tilted about x through
 * `[8, 1, 8]`, which is where it meets the base. The handle's `down` face is
 * omitted, as vanilla omits it: it is buried in the base.
 *
 * **The windows are not optional.** All 320 opaque texels of `lever.png` are
 * in `u 7..9, v 6..16`, so UVs derived from the box would address an empty
 * corner of the tile and the handle would draw *nothing at all* -- the chain's
 * fault on a smaller strip. The strip is not symmetric end to end either: its
 * first two rows are the cap and are measurably brighter, mean luminance 119
 * against 72 at the foot, so laid the wrong way round it is visible.
 *
 * ## Which way it leans, which is the part that reads backwards
 *
 * `powered=false` selects the model called **`lever_on`**, and `powered=true`
 * the one called `lever`. That is not a transcription slip: it is what
 * `blockstates/lever.json` has said in every release from 1.13 to 1.21.9, and
 * it is the model *names* that are misleading rather than the mapping. The
 * appearance settles it -- the wiki's "when placed on the side of blocks, down
 * is on and up is off" -- so an unpowered wall lever has its handle **up**,
 * and the angle that produces that is `lever_on.json`'s `+45`.
 *
 * ## Three positions written out
 *
 * The blockstate turns the one model with `x`, which `rotateShapeBox` knows
 * nothing about. That is `ROD_TURN`'s problem, except that there the parts
 * carry no rotation of their own and here the handle does -- and a `ShapeBox`
 * holds one. So the `x` is applied by hand and the tilt is left as the
 * residual, which puts the pivot where the handle meets the base each time:
 * `[8, 1, 8]` on the floor, `[8, 8, 15]` on a wall, `[8, 15, 8]` on the
 * ceiling. The face names travel with it -- `x: 90` sends up to north, north
 * to down, south to up and down to south -- so the windows are the same six
 * numbers under permuted keys rather than six new ones.
 *
 * The `y` is `rotateShapeBox`'s, from `facing`, and the model is
 * **north-authored**: `face=floor,facing=north` is the variant with no `y` at
 * all. A wall lever's base therefore comes out on the side *opposite* its
 * `facing`, which is `WALL_MOUNTED`'s rule seen from the geometry -- the thing
 * points out of the wall it is screwed to.

/**
 * The three sculk sensors and the shrieker: `sculk_sensor.json`,
 * `calibrated_sculk_sensor.json` and `template_sculk_shrieker.json`.
 *
 * All three were full opaque cubes, and every one of them is **half a block
 * tall with something standing on it**. What that cost is four separate
 * things, and only the first is the silhouette:
 *
 * - **`sculk_sensor_side.png` is 50% transparent, and that is the block being
 *   8 high.** Only the bottom half of the tile is the sensor's flank; vanilla
 *   says so with `uv: [0, 8, 16, 16]`. Stretched over a full cube by
 *   coordinate-derived UVs, every sensor in the game drew its side twice as
 *   tall and half of it was empty;
 * - **`occludesNeighbours` answered true**, so a sensor sealed its own cell.
 *   `lighting.ts` floods from that predicate, which is the amethyst bud's
 *   fault in a redstone block: a corridor of sensors lit itself out. It also
 *   deleted the face of whatever stood on top, the sensor's lid being opaque
 *   while the block under it is only half there;
 * - **the calibrated one wore its own lid on all six faces.** It ships three
 *   textures -- `_amethyst`, `_input_side`, `_top` -- and borrows
 *   `sculk_sensor_side` and `sculk_sensor_bottom` from the plain sensor, which
 *   no candidate list can guess. So `calibrated_sculk_sensor_top` was the one
 *   name that resolved and `cubeFaceTextures`' fallback painted it on the
 *   other five: the dispenser's fault, one block along;
 * - **and the tendrils, the amethyst and the shrieker's bowl were simply not
 *   there.** They are what these blocks look like.
 *
 * ## What each property does, and what it does not
 *
 * `sculk_sensor_phase` chooses the **tendril texture and nothing else**:
 * `active` and `cooldown` share one model and `inactive` has the other, and
 * the difference between the two files is one line. `can_summon` chooses the
 * shrieker's `inner_top` the same way -- one texture, no coordinate.
 *
 * `power` moves nothing at all, on either sensor, and neither does
 * `shrieking`: a shrieking shrieker is an animation and a particle, which is
 * `signal_fire`'s answer. `waterlogged` is the generic one.
 *
 * ## The pieces
 *
 * The body is the same 16x8x16 slab on all three, and the tendrils are the
 * same four planes -- zero thickness, 8 by 8, each turned 45 degrees about its
 * own corner, reaching a unit outside the cell on x and up to the top of it.
 * Their windows are `[4, 8, 12, 16]` one way and `[12, 8, 4, 16]` the other,
 * and the reversal is vanilla's own: a window with `u0 > u1` is a mirror,
 * which is how one plane wears the picture from both sides.
 *
 * **Only the tendrils and the amethyst state a window**, and the absence
 * elsewhere is deliberate rather than an omission -- `amethystBud`'s rule.
 * Vanilla writes `[0, 8, 16, 16]` on the slab's flanks and `[1, 1, 15, 8]` on
 * the rim's, and both are exactly what this file derives from the box: the
 * flank of an 8-tall block *is* the lower half of its tile, which is why that
 * texture is half transparent. Measured over all 102 faces of the three blocks
 * at every facing, stating them changes not one uv. What would have to be kept
 * correct is a copy of the coordinates.
 *
 * The calibrated sensor adds two crossed amethyst planes and an input side.
 * They carry `rescale: true`, which this file has no notion of, so they are
 * written **already rescaled** -- `pottedPlant`'s idiom. A 45-degree turn
 * rescales by `sqrt(2)`, so vanilla's 0..16 becomes `8 +/- 8 * sqrt(2)` here
 * and lands corner to corner of the cell, which is where a rescaled cross ends
 * up and where the amethyst has to be.
 *
 * The shrieker is a bowl, and that needs the five inward planes vanilla
 * states: `sculk_shrieker_top.png` is 16.5% opaque with a hole clean through
 * the middle, so what you see through it is the rim's inside and the
 * `inner_top` on the floor of the slab below. Each of those planes carries one
 * face in vanilla and would emit two here -- coincident with the rim's own,
 * which is a flickering seam -- so each `omit`s the outward one.

/**
 * A chain, transcribed from `chain.json`.
 *
 * It was a solid 3x3 post, and that is the wrong *kind* of wrong: `chain.png`
 * is a sheet, three pixels of link beside three pixels of link seen edge-on,
 * so a box wearing it does not merely have the wrong silhouette, it samples
 * pixels that were never meant for those faces. The lantern failure again,
 * which this file already carries a note about.
 *
 * Vanilla draws two **zero-thickness planes** crossed at 45 degrees, each with
 * an explicit UV window into that sheet. Both are expressible here: `tiltFace`
 * takes any of the three axes, `boxFaces` drops the four faces a plane has no
 * area on, and the viewport's material is `DoubleSide`, so a plane is visible
 * from behind.
 *
 * The reversed windows -- `[3, 0, 0, 16]` has `u0 > u1` -- are vanilla's way of
 * mirroring a face, and `windowUvsFrom` does no ordering check, so they carry
 * across unchanged.
 *
 * ## A horizontal chain is that model turned, picture and all
 *
 * The `x` and `z` variants are written out as their own boxes rather than
 * rotated -- and were written with **no `uv` at all**, so instead of the
 * 3-wide strip of links they took coordinate-derived UVs running the whole
 * width of the tile. Measured on the shipped pack: all 696 opaque texels of
 * `iron_chain.png` live in its first six columns, so the band a sideways
 * chain sampled -- `v 6.5..9.5` across all sixteen -- came out **16%
 * opaque**. Five sixths of it drew nothing, and the sixth that did drew a
 * 3-pixel band of link stretched along the whole run. Reported as an
 * incomplete mesh *and* a badly sewn texture, which is one fault seen from
 * both sides.
 *
 * The windows below are the vertical chain's, laid along the run, and two
 * measured facts fix them with no freedom left:
 *
 * - the window's **16-texel axis follows the length** and its 3-texel axis
 *   goes across, which is what the `uvRotation`s are for: the quad's own
 *   axes are transposed by the turn, and a window without the rotation
 *   names the right texels and lays them sideways -- the anvil's case;
 * - the window's **`v = 0` edge sits where the turn sends the vertical
 *   chain's top**. The turn is not a guess: the tilt goes from `y` to `x`,
 *   and conjugating a 45 degree turn about Y into one about X takes a
 *   rotation about **Z**, `(x, y) -> (y, 16 - x)`, which sends `y = 16` to
 *   `x = 16`. For `axis=z` the tilt moves to Z, so the rotation is about X,
 *   `(y, z) -> (16 - z, y)`, and `y = 16` goes to `z = 16`.
 *
 * The second is a real choice rather than a free one: the sheet is **not**
 * symmetric under a half turn -- 936 of the 1536 texels in the two strips
 * differ from their opposite -- so laying the strip end for end is visible,
 * and a check on the proportion alone would not see it. Which is also why
 * that check exists beside this one: coordinate-derived UVs are 16 by 3 as
 * well. They are simply 16 of the wrong texels.

/**
 * An amethyst bud or cluster: `block/cross`, turned by `facing`.
 *
 * All four -- the three buds and the cluster -- are the identical model with a
 * different texture, so the whole size difference lives in the art. Counted
 * off the bundled pack, on a 64x64 tile: 354 opaque texels for the small bud,
 * 690 for the medium, 1114 for the large and 2104 for the cluster. There is
 * not one coordinate between them.
 *
 * They were **cubes**, which is two faults and not one. The silhouette was
 * wrong -- a pointed crystal drawn as a solid block wearing its own sprite on
 * all six sides -- and `occludesNeighbours` answered `true`, so a bud **sealed
 * its cell**: `lighting.ts` floods from that predicate, and a geode with buds
 * lining its walls put itself in the dark. That it did not also delete its
 * neighbours' faces was luck rather than design -- `isTextureOpaque` refuses
 * on the decoded alpha, for a reason with nothing to do with this block.
 *
 * ## Three parts written, three derived
 *
 * The blockstate applies `x: 180` for `down`, `x: 90` for `north`, and `x: 90`
 * plus a `y` for the other three horizontals. `rotateShapeBox` carries a box's
 * own rotation correctly through a `y` but knows nothing about `x`, so the
 * `x: 90` is applied here, once, as `(x, y, z) -> (x, z, 16 - y)` about the
 * centre. Which way that sends the model's top is not a guess: `south` is
 * `north` plus `y: 180`, so `x: 90` alone has to point north.
 *
 * **No `uv` window is stated below**, and that is deliberate rather than an
 * omission. Every plane spans 0..16 on both of its own axes, so the UVs
 * derived from the coordinates already *are* vanilla's `[0, 0, 16, 16]`;
 * writing them out would be a no-op to keep correct through four rotations.
 * What each facing needs is a per-face `uvRotation`, because the sprite's tip
 * is at the top of its tile and has to come out pointing along `facing`.
 *
 * The **sign** of the 45-degree roll is immaterial for a cross, which is worth
 * saying because it looks exactly like the thing to get backwards: the pair
 * {0, 90} rolled by +45 is {45, 135} and rolled by -45 is {-45, 45}, the same
 * pair. All it decides is which of the two planes takes which diagonal, and
 * they wear the same texture through the same window. The corollary is worth
 * having too -- "the planes came out swapped" is not evidence the sign is
 * wrong, because nothing on screen can tell.
 *
 * Written at their **already-rescaled** width, `pottedPlant`'s idiom: vanilla
 * states 0.8..15.2 with `rescale: true`, there is no rescale here, and 0..16
 * turned 45 degrees reaches 8 +/- 8/sqrt(2), which is what `kind: "cross"`
 * builds and what the rescale arrives at.

 * list that cannot know.
 *
 * Naming the textures per box is what fixes that, and it is also why the
 * plural is not added to the generic list here: that would be a one-line

 * And `facing` did nothing at all -- the entry was `() => boxes(...)`, with no

 * An anvil, from `template_anvil.json`: a wide foot, a waist, and the block on

 *
 * Authored **facing south** -- its blockstate gives `facing=south` no rotation,
 * which is worth reading off the file rather than guessing, because the anvil
 * is not symmetric and a quarter-turn puts its long axis across the run.
 *
 * ## Two textures, and one of them is the whole point of the block
 *
 * `#body` is `block/anvil` on every face but one, and `#top` -- `anvil_top`,
 * `chipped_anvil_top`, `damaged_anvil_top` -- is the face the hammer lands on.
 * **That face is the only difference between the three anvils**, so a block
 * that does not state it draws all three identically.
 *
 * Naming them here rather than leaving it to `cubeFaceTextures` is not a
 * refinement, it is the fix. That function guesses from the block's name, and
 * `chipped_anvil` has exactly one texture in the pack: `chipped_anvil_top`. So
 * it answered that for all six faces and a chipped anvil came out as a solid
 * shape wearing the picture of its own dented top, base included.
 *
 * ## Its windows are the model's, and they are rotated
 *
 * `anvil.png` is a *sheet* rather than a full-block tile -- the foot's band,
 * the waist and the block are cut from different parts of it -- so the windows
 * are transcribed, and several carry vanilla's `rotation`: the west face of the
 * foot is a 4-wide, 12-tall window laid onto a face 12 wide and 4 tall. The
 * reversed pairs (`east: [4, 2, 0, 14]`) are vanilla mirroring a face, which
 * `windowUvsFrom` reproduces by doing no ordering check.
 *
 * Faces vanilla omits are omitted: the waist has no top or bottom and the
 * step above it no bottom, because in each case the next box covers it.

/**
 * The sign sheets are **32 wide**, and their parts are unwrapped on them.
 *
 * The comment above used to say the layout "does not match any unwrap this
 * file could derive with confidence", and the reason it did not was arithmetic:
 * `unwrapCube` assumed a 64-wide sheet, so every window it produced on a 32-wide
 * one covered a quarter of what it named. Told the width, it lands.
 *
 * The hanging sign's board settles it, because four independent numbers agree
 * with one box. `oak_hanging_sign.png` has exactly one 14-wide patch at
 * `(2, 14)-(16, 16)` and one 32-wide band at `(0, 16)-(32, 26)`, and
 * `unwrapCube(0, 14, 14, 10, 2)` puts `down` at `(2, 14)` 14 wide, and the four
 * sides in a band `2 * (14 + 2) = 32` wide and `dy = 10` tall. Nothing was
 * chosen to make that come out; it is where the paint is.
 *
 * The standing sign's board is the same reasoning with one number left over:
 * its side band is 26 wide, which is `2 * (11 + 2)`, and its cap band is two
 * rows tall, which is `dz = 2` — but the caps run from 0 rather than from
 * `dz`, and 24 columns rather than 22. So `dx = 11` is what the band widths
 * say and the two extra columns are unexplained. It is stated here rather than
 * smoothed over: the board lands in the plank field either way, and the
 * difference between this and a neighbouring fit is a column.
 *
 * The bar, the post and the chains are approximations of a different kind:
 * a window over the right *material* rather than a transcription of the right
 * part. Before them the chains sampled whatever a box's coordinates happened
 * to point at, which for one of the two was the plank field — a wooden chain
