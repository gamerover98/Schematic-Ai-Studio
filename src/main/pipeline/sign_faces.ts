/**
 * A sign's text, laid out on its board as quads.
 *
 * This is the only geometry in the pipeline that is a function of a *position*
 * rather than of a palette entry: two signs of the same block state say
 * different things. So it cannot be baked — `bakeBlockstate` is memoised on the
 * state and would hand the second sign the first one's words — and it is built
 * here, per cell, by `culledFaces`.
 *
 * Everything about *where* the board is lives in `block_shapes.ts` and arrives
 * as a `SignTextPlane`. What is left is layout, and the layout is deliberately
 * free of compass arithmetic: the pen walks along the plane's `right` and the
 * lines step down its `up`, so the same code writes all eight orientations and
 * a sign turned east cannot come out mirrored.
