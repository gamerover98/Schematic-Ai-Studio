/**
 * How bright each cell is, and how buried each corner is.
 *
 * Two grids and one corner test, all of it the game's own arithmetic:
 *
 * - **block light** spreads from things that glow, losing one level per step.
 * - **sky light** falls straight down a column until something stops it, then
 *   spreads sideways losing a level per step. It is stored separately from
 *   block light because it is the half that *changes with the time of day*:
 *   the viewer dims it and leaves a torch alone, which is what makes a lit
 *   room stay lit at night.
 * - **ambient occlusion** is per vertex, from the three cells that meet at that
 *   corner. Nothing to do with the two grids; it is geometry, not light.
 *
 * ## Why this is in main
 *
 * Occlusion at a vertex depends on the blocks *around* it, and the renderer has
 * no blocks -- it receives geometry. The same is true of light: propagation is
 * a flood fill over the voxel grid. Both have to be baked into the mesh, which
 * means both belong beside the mesher. `preview.showAmbientOcclusion` used to
 * be a viewer setting that changed the intensity of two lights, which is a
 * different thing wearing the same name.
 *
 * ## What crosses to the renderer
 *
 * Three numbers per vertex, packed into the colour attribute: block light, sky
 * light, and occlusion, each 0..1. The material decides what to do with them,
 * which is what lets the time of day move without re-meshing anything.
