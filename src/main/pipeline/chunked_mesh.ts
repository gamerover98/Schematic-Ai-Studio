/**
 * Meshing a document one chunk at a time, and re-meshing only what changed.
 *
 * Rebuilding the whole structure after every edit is what the app did, and it
 * is fine at the size of a house — measured, 167 ms — and slow at the size of a
 * castle: 1.5 s for a 256x64x256, of which culling alone is 1.1 s. Placing one
 * block should not cost that.
 *
 * The structure is cut into 16-block cubes, each meshed independently and
 * cached. A rebuild re-meshes only the chunks whose contents moved and
 * concatenates the rest.
 *
 * ## Which chunks are dirty is *observed*, not announced
 *
 * The cache keeps a snapshot of the voxel grid and diffs it. No caller has to
 * remember to report an edit, which matters because there are several ways to
 * make one — the panel, the crosshair, the agent's tools, an undo — and a
 * notification missed at any of them would render a stale chunk with no clue
 * as to why. Comparing two typed arrays of four million entries costs a few
 * milliseconds; being wrong costs a bug nobody can reproduce.
 *
 * ## A changed block dirties its neighbours' chunks too
 *
 * Whether a face is drawn depends on the block next to it, so a block on a
 * chunk boundary changes what the chunk across that boundary should draw.
 * Every changed voxel therefore dirties its own chunk and those of its six
 * face-neighbours.
 *
 * ## What invalidates everything
 *
 * The dimensions changing (a resize renumbers every index), the atlas
 * changing (cached UVs address the old layout), and the void block changing
 * (`fillVoid` rewrites the palette under the same indices). The palette
 * *growing* does not: it is append-only, so an index cached earlier still
 * means the same block.
 *
 * That third one is the odd member and is worth reading twice, because it is
 * the only invalidator that is not a fact about the document. `fillVoid` hands
 * this function a structure whose palette has been rewritten -- index 0 is
 * water rather than air -- over the document's own voxels, which have not
 * moved. Every empty cell in the schematic changes appearance while all three
 * grids compare equal, so the cache carried every chunk forward and the answer
 * shipped was a correct one to the wrong question. See `voidDigest`.
