/**
 * The compile-time version table `core.ts`'s `inputVersionToMcsTag` was written
 * to receive.
 *
 * RULEBOOK.md DEV-014 / ARCHITECTURE.md §5: the inventory row for
 * `input_version_to_mcs_tag` demanded "an explicit lookup table built at
 * compile time", replacing Python's `getattr(mcschematic.Version, name)`
 * dynamic attribute lookup. This IS that table; the function keeps its
 * parameter so it stays independently testable.
 *
 * ## The data moved, the interface did not
 *
 * The rows now live in `shared/mc_versions.ts`, because three places need the
 * same answer and only one of them is main: the format picker offers
 * containers, the writers refuse the ones that cannot work, and the block
 * inventory filters what it shows. What is left here is the *shape* `core.ts`
 * and generation want — a flat `name -> number` map — derived from it.
 *
 * That derivation drops the legacy rows, and deliberately. Most of them *do*
 * have a `DataVersion` -- 1.12.2 is 1343 -- but a caller iterating this table is
 * building a Sponge file, and Sponge cannot express a pre-Flattening version at
 * all. Filtering on the number rather than on the era would let generation
 * stamp 1343 onto a schematic whose palette is flattened block names. The full
 * list, both eras, is `MC_VERSION_NAMES`.
 *
 * The old note here said "range starts at 1.13" as though that were a property
 * of Minecraft. It was a property of this table. The range now starts at 1.8.8
 * and the Flattening is recorded as what it is: the line between two eras, with
 * different block encodings and different containers on either side.

 * DataVersion of 1343, and generation writing that number into a Sponge file
 * would produce a schematic claiming to be pre-Flattening while its palette
 * holds flattened block names. Only 1.8.x has no number at all.
 *
 * Built rather than written out, so there is one list of versions in the app
 * and not two that can disagree.
