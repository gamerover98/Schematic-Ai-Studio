/**
 * Turning one schematic file into another, without opening it.
 *
 * "Convert" already existed as a gesture -- open the file, Save As in the other
 * container -- and it went through the open document, which is wrong twice.
 * It costs the user their unsaved work if they had any, and it has no answer at
 * all for `.mcfunction`, which is read but never *becomes* the document's
 * format. So this is a verb of its own: a file goes in, a file comes out, and
 * whatever is open is untouched.
 *
 * There is no format code here and that is the point. It loads with
 * `loadStructure`, builds a document with `documentFromLoaded`, and writes with
 * `writeDocument` or `buildMcfunction` -- every one of which is the same path
 * the editor uses, so a conversion cannot be right in a way that opening the
 * file is not.
 *
 * ## It never overwrites
 *
 * A file already at the destination is moved aside under a timestamp, through
 * `resolveOutputPath`. That is `save_document_as`'s rule and it is here for the
 * same reason: this verb is reachable by an agent, and an agent that guesses a
 * path badly should cost a rename rather than somebody's build.
 *
 * ## It does not crop
 *
 * `saveSession` trims to content, because saving is the end of an editing
 * session and the room you made to build in is not part of the build. A
 * conversion is not an editing session: the size is a property of the file
 * being converted, and quietly returning a smaller one would make the two files
 * disagree about what the schematic is.
