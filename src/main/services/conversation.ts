/**
 * The conversation: the visible log, the model's memory of it, and its file.
 *
 * ## Both halves, one object
 *
 * The log used to live in the renderer and the model's messages on the session.
 * Two owners of one thing, which only worked because they were always thrown
 * away together. They are written to disk now, and a crash between two writes
 * would leave a log describing edits the agent has no record of — so they are
 * one record, saved in one call.
 *
 * ## Why not on `DocumentSession`
 *
 * Hanging it there made it die with the document for free, which was most of
 * the appeal. It cannot take that deal any more, for two reasons that pull the
 * same way. It has to *survive* a document swap in one case — asking the chat
 * to build something with nothing open generates a file and then opens it, and
 * the question must not vanish with the session. And it has to survive the
 * document being closed entirely, because reopening that schematic brings the
 * conversation back.
 *
 * So the rule is written out instead of inherited: a conversation has a
 * **subject**, the document it is about. Opening a file it has no subject for
 * is an adoption; opening a different one saves what is there and loads that
 * file's own.
 *
 * ## The directory is injected
 *
 * `app.getPath("userData")` lives in Electron, and importing Electron here
 * would put this module out of reach of the test suites — the same trap
 * `recent_documents.ts` was split out of `settings-store.ts` to avoid. The app
 * calls `useConversationDirectory` at startup; the tests point it at a temp
 * folder and exercise the real files.
