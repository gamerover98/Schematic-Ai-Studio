/**
 * Ported from `app/preview.py` (`build_preview`, `PreviewOptions`,
 * `PreviewPayload`) plus `component.py:419-434`'s `_cached_preview`.
 *
 * Two things from the Python version deliberately do not survive
 * (ARCHITECTURE.md §3 "Viewer lifecycle"):
 *
 * 1. **base64.** `preview.py:88-89` encoded the GLB so it could be embedded in
 *    the viewer HTML that Streamlit injected into an iframe. The renderer here
 *    receives the raw bytes over IPC.
 * 2. **The temp directory.** `preview.py:69-87` wrote the schem and the
 *    resource pack to a `TemporaryDirectory` only because `load_structure` and
 *    `ModelBaker` take paths, not bytes. The Electron flow already has real
 *    paths (the file picker returns one), so the round-trip through disk is
 *    gone; callers that only hold bytes write them once, up front.
 *
 * `PreviewPayload.to_viewer_params` is gone entirely -- that dict existed to
 * be JSON-embedded in the viewer template. Its fields are now the typed
 * `PreviewSuccess` in `shared/ipc.ts`.

 * void block is void* -- which is why the answer is keyed on the palette
 * rather than on whether a cell used to be air.
 *
 * The consequence is worth stating before it is reported as a bug: with
 * water as the void block, water placed by hand is unpickable too. That is
 * the request rather than a side effect -- if water is what empty space is
 * made of, a click has to pass through it the way it passes through air.
 *
 * ## The second population needs `matchesBlockPattern`, and used to have
 * ## exact-key equality
 *
 * The rule above was written and the comparison was `paletteEntryCacheKey`
 * equality, states and all -- so a cell only joined the void if its full
 * state string was byte-identical to the one the setting parses to. A cell
 * a *break* wrote always is, because it is written from that same string.

 * whenever the texture set grows, and meshing blocks one at a time grows it on

 * meshing all 920 against a settled atlas is ~150 ms -- against ~38,750 ms for
 * the same work done in an order that let the atlas move.

 * the work being repeated is quadratic, and the baker's texture map is one
 * mutable object that cannot be shared across threads anyway.
 *
 * A block that fails to bake is skipped rather than fatal. It contributes no
 * texture, so it cannot move the atlas, and whatever is wrong with it will be
 * wrong again where it is actually asked for -- with a message about what it
 * was, which is not something this loop could give.
