 *
 * - **The choice itself is a preference, not a mutation.** It changes what
 *   empty space is *drawn* as and what a future break will *write*; it moves
 *   no block, so it is not on the undo stack. Ctrl+Z after changing it takes
 *   back whatever you did before it, which is the honest answer.
 * - **The rewrite is an edit**, and it is one transaction, so a swap of a
 *   quarter of a million cells is one Ctrl+Z.
 *
 * They are asked for separately, and that is the second thing this got wrong.
 * The rewrite used to ride along with the choice, read from a checkbox at the
 * moment the block changed -- so ticking the box *after* picking water did
 * nothing at all, and re-picking water to make it fire hit a short-circuit that
 * said you had chosen what was already chosen. The one gesture anybody would
 * try was the one with no answer.
 *
 * So `replaceFrom` is explicit rather than read from the session. By the time
 * somebody presses the button the choice has already landed -- that is what
 * makes the viewport show it -- so `session.voidBlock` is the *new* value and
 * would convert a block into itself. The caller names the old one because the
 * caller is the only one still holding it.
 *
 * It is not enough on its own, and `sources` below says why: the setting and
 * the cells can disagree, and two documents that look identical from the
 * setting can differ entirely in what they contain.
 *
 * `from` is built with `toEntry` and not with any defaults-filling helper,
 * because it is a *pattern*: `tx.replace` interns it and matches on the
 * palette index, so writing default properties onto it would turn "take out
 * the water" into "take out the water that happens to be at level 0" -- which
 * finds a fraction of it and reports a healthy count for those. Same reason
 * `replace_blocks` parses its `from` and places its `to`.
 *
 * The volume goes through `MAX_EDIT_VOLUME` like any other edit. It is not a
 * formality here: air is most of an ordinary schematic, so this is the one
 * edit that genuinely does touch every cell, and one delta per changed voxel
 * is exactly the unbounded allocation that cap exists to stop.

/**
 * Changes which Minecraft version this schematic is for, as one undoable step.
 *
 * There was no way to do this at all. A version could be chosen when a document
 * was created and stamped when it was saved, and nothing in between -- so
 * saying "this is a 1.12 schematic" about a file that arrived without a tag
 * meant a Save As, and so did changing 1.21 to 1.16.
 *
 * **The container is not changed here, and a version it cannot carry is
 * refused.** `doc.format` is what a plain Save writes back, so flipping it
 * under an open file would leave the next Ctrl+S writing MCEdit bytes into
 * something still called `.schem`. Save As and Convert both exist and both
 * change the pair together; this verb changes one thing.
 *
 * ## Three things happen, in this order, and the order is the whole design
 *
 * 1. **Rename.** `chain` becomes `iron_chain` going past 1.21.9 and back again
 *    coming under it. Nothing is lost, nothing is counted, nothing is asked.
 * 2. **Rewrite the states** the target cannot say -- a wall's `north=tall`
 *    becomes `north=true` before 1.16, because that release is where a wall
 *    connection stopped being a boolean.
 * 3. **Drop what is left**, and only that.
 *
 * Doing 3 before 1 is not a worse version of this: it is the demolition this
 * function exists to prevent. A registry diff sees `chain` disappear at 1.21.9
 * and `iron_chain` appear and cannot tell that from two unrelated events, so a
 * backport that checked existence first would find `iron_chain` absent from
 * 1.16 and replace every one of them with empty space -- while the correct
 * answer, `chain`, is a name that version has had since it shipped.
 *
 * ## What replaces a dropped block
 *
 * The document's **empty space** (`session.voidBlock`), not air. A break already
 * writes it, and an underwater build that came back full of air bubbles would
 * have lost exactly what that setting exists to preserve. It falls back to air
 * when the empty space block is itself too new for the target -- which is a real
 * case, `structure_void` being 1.10.
 *
 * A backport is refused first and counted, and only goes through with
 * `dropUnrepresentable`: a warning shown after the blocks are gone is not a
 * warning.
 *
 * One transaction, so Ctrl+Z takes back the version, the names, the states
 * *and* the blocks together. That costs nothing to arrange: `HeaderState` has
 * captured and restored `dataVersion` since it existed.
