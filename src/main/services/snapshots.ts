/**
 * A schematic's own version history, on disk, per file.
 *
 * The chat can already put a schematic back to how it was before a question —
 * that is `checkpoints.ts`, and it belongs to a conversation, dies with it, and
 * only ever covers agent turns. This is the other half: versions of the *file*,
 * kept beside it in userData, surviving the conversation, the session and the
 * app being closed.
 *
 * It is what the Generate tab shows. A generation replaces everything that was
 * open, which makes it the single most destructive thing the app does and the
 * one place a way back is worth the disk.
 *
 * ## Uncropped, like every other snapshot here
 *
 * `saveSession` trims a schematic to its content on the way out, which is right
 * for the user's file and wrong for this: coming back would hand them the build
 * without the room they had made to build in. So this calls the writers
 * directly, exactly as `autosave.ts` and `checkpoints.ts` do.
 *
 * ## Sponge v3, whatever the document is
 *
 * These files are only ever read back by this module, so they should be in the
 * container that loses the least — an MCEdit round trip would quietly drop
 * block states the document still has.
 *
 * ## Keyed by path, and a document with no path has no history
 *
 * The key is the file, so the history follows the schematic rather than the
 * session. An unsaved document therefore has nowhere to keep one; it gets a
 * history the moment it is first saved, which is the same rule conversations
 * follow.
