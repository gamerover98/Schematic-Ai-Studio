/**
 * One block, meshed on its own, so the inventory can draw it.
 *
 * The creative inventory shows blocks as they look, not as names — a stairs
 * block has to *be* a stairs block on screen. That geometry is described in
 * `pipeline/block_shapes.ts`, which lives in main and cannot be imported by the
 * renderer, so the icons are built here and the geometry crosses the boundary
 * the same way the viewport's does.
 *
 * ## It is the same pipeline, on a 1x1x1 document
 *
 * Not a second mesher, not a table of pre-rendered sprites. A one-block
 * document goes through `buildDocumentPreview` exactly as an open schematic
 * does, which means an icon cannot disagree with what appears in the viewport
 * when the block is placed. A stand-in built by other means would drift the
 * moment `block_shapes.ts` gained a shape — and drift silently, because nothing
 * compares the two.
 *
 * Face culling removes nothing here: a lone block has all six faces exposed,
 * which is what an icon wants.
 *
 * ## Cached, because the answer never changes
 *
 * A block's geometry depends on the block and on the texture atlas, and the
 * atlas has a version already. So the cache is keyed on both and a scroll
 * through the inventory re-meshes nothing it has seen. Without it, sixty
 * one-block documents would be built per row of scrolling.

 * texture count -- so meshing sixty blocks in a row produced sixty geometries,
 * each with UVs addressing a different atlas layout, and one atlas to draw them
 * all with. Fifty-nine of them were wrong. Scrolling away and back looked like
 * a fix because by then everything had been decoded and the count had stopped
 * changing.
 *
 * It used to prime by *meshing* every block and throwing the geometry away,
 * on the grounds that a 1x1x1 document is a handful of triangles and the
 * expensive half is the decoding. The triangles were indeed free. What was not
 * free was that each of those meshes asked for an atlas, and the atlas is
 * repacked whenever the texture set has grown -- so priming nine hundred blocks
 * packed the atlas nine hundred times over an ever-larger set. That was 38.7 of

 *
 * So it decodes directly and packs once. Same guarantee, two orders of
 * magnitude cheaper, and `warmBaker` carries the measurements.
