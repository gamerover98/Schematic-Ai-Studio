/**
 * Going back to how the schematic was before a question.
 *
 * A snapshot is taken *before* each agent turn, and the chat offers to return
 * to it from the user message that started that turn. On disk, so it outlives
 * the session — walking the undo stack would have been cheaper and would have
 * stopped working the moment the file was closed, which is precisely when
 * someone wants it.
 *
 * ## The three things that are easy to get wrong here
 *
 * **A checkpoint must not be cropped.** `saveSession` trims a schematic to its
 * content on the way out, which is right for the user's file and wrong for
 * this: coming back would hand them the build without the room they had made
 * to build in. So this calls the writers directly, exactly as `autosave.ts`
 * does and for the same reason.
 *
 * **`doc.revision` is the key.** It is monotonic and bumped by every mutation,
 * so an unchanged revision means an unchanged document and the previous
 * snapshot still describes it. That is what makes the failed-turn case free: a
 * run that rolls back leaves the revision where it started, and the next turn
 * reuses the same file rather than writing an identical one.
 *
 * **Restoring cannot be undone.** `adoptDocument` starts a fresh history, so
 * there is no stack to walk back across. The way back is that restoring takes
 * a checkpoint of the current state first — a fork, not a one-way door.
 *
 * ## What is stored
 *
 * A Sponge v3 `.schem` and a `.json` beside it holding the model's messages as
 * they stood. The messages matter: without them, going back would leave a
 * conversation the agent has no memory of, and every turn above the fork would
 * read as history. Sponge v3 whatever the document's own format, like the
 * autosave, because this file is only ever read back by this module and should
 * be the container that loses the least.
