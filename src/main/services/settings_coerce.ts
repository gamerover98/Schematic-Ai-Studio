/**
 * Merging a persisted settings blob over the defaults, as pure data.
 *
 * Split from `settings-store.ts` for the same reason `recent_documents.ts` was:
 * that module imports Electron for `app.getPath` and `safeStorage`, which puts
 * everything in it out of reach of the test suites. And this is the part that
 * most needs reaching, because its failure mode is silence.
 *
 * `coerceUi` builds a fresh object literal instead of spreading, and it runs on
 * read *and* on write. A field added to `UiSettings` but not named here is
 * therefore dropped when the renderer saves -- the setting appears to work for
 * the rest of the session and is gone after a reload, with nothing logged.
 * CLAUDE.md records this as a standing trap; `tests/services.ts` now holds a
 * test that fails if a field goes missing from either object.
