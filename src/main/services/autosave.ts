/**
 * Crash recovery for the open document.
 *
 * The rule the plan sets is that autosave is *separate from the user's file*:
 * it must never write over what they chose to save, because the whole point is
 * to preserve work they have not decided about yet. So a snapshot is a Sponge
 * v3 `.schem` in the app's own directory, plus a sidecar recording where the
 * document actually belongs.
 *
 * ## Polling a counter, not listening for changes
 *
 * There is no `noteChange()` for callers to remember to call. A timer compares
 * `doc.revision` — monotonic, bumped by every mutation including an undo —
 * against the revision last written, and snapshots when they differ. Comparing
 * an integer every twenty seconds costs nothing, and unlike a notification it
 * cannot be forgotten at a new call site.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not snapshotted
 *
 * The undo history. Recovering *what you had* is the promise; recovering the
 * path you took to it is not, and serialising the stack would mean versioning
 * a second on-disk format for a case nobody has asked for. A restored document
 * starts with an empty history and is marked as differing from disk.
