/**
 * The application menu, and the window title.
 *
 * There was none at all before this — `Menu.setApplicationMenu` appeared
 * nowhere in the project — which meant no File, no Ctrl+N, no Ctrl+O and no
 * Open Recent. Everything about files existed and worked, and lived entirely
 * inside a sidebar tab that is not the default one, plus a command palette you
 * have to already know about. On Windows the menu bar is the first place a
 * person looks.
 *
 * This module is the Electron half and holds no decisions: what the menu
 * contains, which items are enabled, and what the title says are all in
 * `menu_model.ts`, which imports nothing and can therefore be tested.
 *
 * ## Why the menu is main's
 *
 * Because the accelerators are. An accelerator declared in a `Menu` is claimed
 * before the window ever sees the keystroke, so a menu and a `keydown`
 * listener cannot both own Ctrl+S — one of them silently stops working. Where
 * this menu takes a key, `App.svelte` has given it up.
