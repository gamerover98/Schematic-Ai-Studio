/**
 * The schematic tools, as MCP sees them.
 *
 * `agent/tools.ts` holds the definitions; this file is the adapter and the
 * safety rail around them. Nothing here re-describes what `fill_region` does —
 * two places deciding that is how you get a tool that works in the chat and not
 * over MCP.
 *
 * ## One tool call is one transaction
 *
 * The in-app agent wraps a whole *turn* in one transaction, because a turn is
 * one thing the user asked for. MCP has no turns: a call arrives from a model
 * this process knows nothing about, and there is no signal that says the next
 * one belongs with it. So each call is its own transaction, which is also what
 * a hand edit is — a fill from the selection tools is one undo step too, and
 * `run_build_script` exists precisely so a large build is one call rather than
 * four hundred.
 *
 * What that buys, for free and at every call: rollback when a tool throws, the
 * neighbour-connection pass in `domain/connect.ts`, and one Ctrl+Z per thing
 * the model did.
 *
 * ## Calls are serialised
 *
 * `runTransactionAsync` awaits, so two overlapping mutations would interleave
 * inside one document — one recorder's rollback undoing the other's writes.
 * Main is single-threaded but that is no protection here, because the await is
 * exactly where another request gets in. Every mutating call therefore queues
 * behind the last one. Read-only calls do not queue: they take no recorder, and
 * making them wait would mean a `get_region` blocking behind a build script.
