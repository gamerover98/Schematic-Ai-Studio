/**
 * The verbs that need an effect this process has to inject.
 *
 * Mostly the ones about the *file* rather than the blocks in it — open, create,
 * save, close, delete — plus the one that photographs the window, which needs
 * the same treatment for the same reason: it reaches Electron, and the rule it
 * has to obey is worth testing without it.
 *
 * Deliberately not in `agent/tools.ts`, and that asymmetry is the design. The
 * in-app agent edits the schematic the user opened; it has no business opening
 * a different one, and a model that could would be able to close the document
 * out from under the person typing to it. An MCP client is in the opposite
 * position — it has no window and no hands, so if it cannot open a file it
 * cannot start.
 *
 * ## Everything is injected
 *
 * These reach the session, the recents list, the conversation store and the OS
 * trash, and half of those import Electron. So the effects arrive as a
 * `Lifecycle` object: the server passes the real ones, `tests/mcp.ts` passes
 * fakes and can then check what a refusal actually refused rather than only
 * what it said. The same split `discard_prompt.ts` was made for, one level up.
 *
 * ## Where the guards are
 *
 * In `policy.ts`, and asked *before* the effect rather than inside it —
 * `openDocument` reassigns the session without looking at what was there, so by
 * the time it has the request the work is already gone. Exactly the reasoning
 * behind the discard dialog living in front of the call rather than inside
 * `session.ts`.
