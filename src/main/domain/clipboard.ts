/**
 * Copying a region out, and pasting it back somewhere else.
 *
 * The clipboard holds a *detached* snapshot: palette entries by value, not
 * palette indices. Indices only mean something relative to the document they
 * came from, and the whole point of a clipboard is to survive leaving that
 * document — copy from a castle, open a village, paste the tower. Storing
 * indices would paste the right numbers and the wrong blocks.
 *
 * ## Air is not stored, and not pasted
 *
 * A copied region is a box, and most of a box is air. Storing that air would
 * make every clipboard cost what its selection *spans* rather than what is in
 * it; pasting it would punch a rectangular hole in whatever the paste lands on,
 * so a house copied off flat ground would arrive having excavated a pit around
 * itself. Only the cells holding something are kept.
 *
 * `includeAir` still means what it says, and is reached the other way round: it
 * clears the destination box before writing. Same result for the case that
 * wants it — stamping a hollow room into solid rock — without storing a box of
 * nothing to get there.
 *
 * ## Out of bounds is clipped here, and decided one layer up
 *
 * `pasteClipboard` writes the part that fits and drops the rest, which is what
 * lets `moveRegion` and friends compose it without bounds arithmetic of their
 * own to get wrong. It is not what a user meets: `pasteSelection` grows the
 * document to hold the whole thing, or refuses by name with automatic resizing
 * off, so the clipping below is the floor rather than the policy.
