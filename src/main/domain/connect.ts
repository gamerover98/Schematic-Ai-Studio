/**
 * Rewriting the block states that depend on what is next to them.
 *
 * A fence has an arm on its north side because there is something to the north,
 * and `block_shapes.ts` draws it from `properties.north`. Nobody was setting
 * that: a fence placed by hand carried the vanilla default, `north=false` on
 * all four sides, which is a bare post. Same for a wall's `up`, a staircase's
 * `shape`, a rail's, and a chest's half of a double chest.
 *
 * `shared/block_connections.ts` holds the rules -- what connects to what -- and
 * knows nothing about documents. This file is the other half: which cells to
 * ask about, and how to ask cheaply enough to run on every edit.
 *
 * ## It runs in one place, and that is the point
 *
 * `runTransaction` calls it, so place, break, fill, replace, paste, move,
 * transform, every agent tool and every generated build script all get the same
 * answer. A rule enforced by discipline at nine call sites is a rule that is
 * wrong at one of them -- and it would be wrong at whichever one was added
 * next.
 *
 * Undo does not go through here, because undo replays recorded deltas rather
 * than running a body; and loading is not a transaction at all. Both are
 * correct: a file that arrives with its own connections keeps exactly those.
 *
 * ## What it costs
 *
 * The obvious implementation reads seven blocks per touched cell and asks each
 * one's *name* whether it is a fence. `occludesNeighbours` alone -- the "is
 * this something a fence attaches to" question -- calls `shapeFor`, which
 * normalises a name with a regex and walks three tables, six times per cell,
 * for a value that cannot differ between two cells holding the same palette
 * entry.
 *
 * So the question is asked of the **palette** instead, once. A document's
 * palette is tens of entries where the cells are millions, and the scan that
 * chooses which cells to visit is seven integer reads with no strings and no
 * allocation. On a 200x50x200 fill of fence -- two million cells every one of
 * which connects on all four sides, the worst case that exists -- that took
 * 17.5 s down to 7.7 s, and the remainder is the two million genuinely
 * different block states it then has to write.
 *
 * What matters more is that the cases anyone actually builds are free:
 *
 * | | | |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | a 100-block fence line | 100 cells | **3 ms** |
 * | one wall of a 64x64 fenced perimeter | 192 cells | **4 ms** |
 * | a 64x32x64 house of stone | 131,072 cells | 125 ms, none of it here |
 * | a 64x8x64 *solid slab of fence* | 32,768 cells | 145 ms |
 *
 * There is deliberately no size cap. A threshold would be a second answer to
 * the same question -- fills under N connect, fills over N do not -- which is
 * the "two doors, two answers" fault this pass exists to remove; and the only
 * shape that reaches seconds is a solid volume of fence, which the fill itself
 * already makes slow and which nobody wants.
