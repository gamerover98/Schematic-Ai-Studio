/**
 * Undo, redo, and the transaction boundary that makes an AI edit one step.
 *
 * The requirement that shapes everything here: if the agent rewrites five
 * hundred blocks to answer one request, CTRL+Z must undo the request, not the
 * five hundredth block. So mutations are recorded into a *transaction*, and the
 * transaction is the unit the stack holds.
 *
 * ## Deltas, not snapshots
 *
 * A transaction stores what changed -- `(voxel index, palette index before,
 * palette index after)` -- never a copy of the schematic. A 500-block edit is
 * 500 triples whatever the structure's size, so the stack costs about as much
 * as the edits it holds rather than a multiple of the document.
 *
 * This works only because of `document.ts`'s append-only palette invariant: a
 * recorded `before` index has to still mean the same block when it is put back,
 * possibly many edits later. That is also why reverting writes to `voxels`
 * directly instead of going through `setBlock` -- the index is already known
 * good, and re-interning would be a no-op at best.
 *
 * ## Resizes are their own command
 *
 * A voxel index only means anything relative to the dimensions in force when it
 * was recorded, so a resize cannot share a command with block writes. Each
 * transaction is therefore a *list* of commands applied in order and reverted
 * in reverse, and a resize always sits in one of its own.
 *
 * ## Dirtiness lives here
 *
 * Not on the document's revision counter, which is monotonic so it can serve as
 * a cache key. `savedDepth` records how deep the undo stack was when the file
 * was last written, so undoing back to that point reads as clean again -- which
 * is what every editor does and what a revision counter cannot express.
