/**
 * Trimming the empty air from around a schematic.
 *
 * Editing tends to leave padding. You grow the box to have somewhere to build,
 * and what you build does not fill it; the file then carries a shell of air
 * around the structure, which every reader has to allocate and every viewer has
 * to frame around. Saving trims it to the outermost non-air block on each of
 * the six sides.
 *
 * **The open document is never modified.** That is not tidiness, it is the
 * `history.ts` invariant: a voxel index only means anything relative to the
 * dimensions in force when it was recorded, so re-dimensioning the live
 * document would invalidate every delta on the undo stack. The crop produces a
 * *copy* for the writer, exactly as the writers already build their own local
 * palette rather than compacting the document's.
