/**
 * What the agent is allowed to do to a schematic.
 *
 * The boundary the plan asks for: the model never touches the document. It
 * calls these, they call the domain, and the domain validates and records. So
 * "the AI edited my build" and "I edited my build" are the same kind of event,
 * on the same undo stack, with the same guarantees.
 *
 * ## Two kinds of tool, on purpose
 *
 * Fine-grained tools (`fill_region`, `replace_blocks`) are right for edits:
 * targeted, inspectable, cheap to describe. But they are a terrible way to
 * *build* — a twenty-block tower is twenty lines of JavaScript and four hundred
 * tool calls. So `run_build_script` keeps the original app's approach as one
 * tool: the model writes a build script, it runs in the same QuickJS sandbox
 * that has always run generated code, and its placements land in the same
 * transaction as everything else.
 *
 * ## Schemas without a new dependency
 *
 * Plain JSON Schema, handed to `jsonSchema()` from `ai` rather than written in
 * zod. Zod is in the tree already, but only as a transitive dependency of `ai`,
 * and reaching into one of those directly is how a minor version bump becomes a
 * build break. The schemas here are half a dozen flat objects; they do not need
 * a DSL.
 *
 * Every `run` re-checks what it was handed anyway. The arguments come from a
 * language model, which is exactly the position `normalizeBlock` is in at the
 * sandbox bridge: a schema is a request, not a guarantee.
 *
 * ## Declared once, consumed twice
 *
 * `TOOL_SPECS` is the definition; `buildTools` derives the `ai` package's
 * `Tool` objects for the in-app agent, and `mcp/tools.ts` reads the same array
 * to serve `tools/list` and `tools/call` over MCP. Keeping one definition is
 * not tidiness -- two places deciding what `fill_region` means is how you get a
 * tool that works in the chat and not over MCP, the same failure `resolveModel`
 * is exported to prevent.
 *
 * It also has to be readable with **no document open**: `tools/list` is
 * answered before any schematic exists, which is why the context is an argument
 * to `run` rather than something the array is built from.

/**
 * The same id, in the state the game would give a block placed just now.
 *
 * ## Why a second function rather than a flag on the first
 *
 * Because half the callers are not placing anything. `replace_blocks` reads
 * `from` as a **pattern**: `tx.replace` matches a palette entry exactly, so a
 * default written onto it turns "take out the campfires" into "take out the
 * campfires that happen to face north, are lit, and are not signal fires" --
 * which finds a fraction of them and reports a cheerful `changed` count for the
 * ones it did find. That is the failure `replace_blocks`'s own `note` already
 * warns about, arriving this time as the fix for a different bug.
 *
 * So the two are named for what they are: one parses, one places.
 *
 * ## Why it is needed at all
 *
 * `placementState` has been doing this since the generated table landed, and it
 * is called in exactly one place -- `App.svelte`, at the click. Every other way
 * a block gets written named it and stopped: an MCP client, the in-app agent
 * and a build script all interned `minecraft:campfire` with an empty property
 * bag. Nothing here notices -- the writers write what they are given and the
 * mesher ignores what it does not recognise -- and the file then reaches a game
 * that fills the gaps with its own defaults, so the bug is invisible until
 * somebody opens the inspector to change one and finds nothing to change.
 *
 * The explicit properties go **over** the defaults, for `placementState`'s
 * reason: `minecraft:campfire[lit=false]` is an instruction and this is only a
 * birth state.
 *
 * There is no orientation half here and there must not be. `orientPlacement`
 * asks where the camera was looking, and a tool call has no camera.
 *
 * One consequence worth knowing: writing more properties changes what the
 * MCEdit writer can match exactly, and so what it reports as `degraded`. That
 * is already why `waterlogged` is left out of the defaults -- see
 * `shared/block_states.ts` -- so this inherits that policy rather than opening
 * a second one.

     *
     * The app's own generation splices the whole block list into its prompt, so
     * the model it drives has always known the answer. A model driving this
     * table had no way to get it: `describe_block` answers about ids you already
     * have, `get_palette` lists what the schematic already uses, and nothing
     * enumerated. So a model building with `run_build_script` guessed names and
     * found out by refusal -- one round trip per guess, and a wrong guess about
     * a *family* (`minecraft:jungle_hanging_sign`) costs several.
     *
     * This arrived when `generate_schematic` left. That tool handed the whole
     * job to the app's own model, which is the thing this server is explicitly
     * not for; what it was genuinely carrying was this list, and this is that
     * without the second model or the second API key.
     *
     * ## It must be the inverse of `checkBlockAllowed`, not a second opinion
     *
     * The one rule. That function accepts a block if it is in `allowedBlocks`
     * **and**, on a pre-Flattening document, in `legacy_blocks.json` -- so this
     * asks both, in the same order, from the same inputs. A list that offered
     * something `set_block` then refused would be worse than no list at all: it
     * would send a model to build with names that cannot land, confidently.
     *
     * Which is why it needs a document rather than sitting in `NO_DOCUMENT`
     * beside `describe_block`. Without one there is no era, and the legacy
     * answer -- 216 names instead of nine hundred -- is half of what this is
     * for.

     * Everything else in this table answers a question about *this* build.
     * This one answers a question about Minecraft, and without it the model had
     * to already know the answer. A block state is the part of a block that is
     * not its name -- `facing`, `half`, `lit`, `signal_fire` -- and nothing in
     * this app validates a property name: the writers write what they are
     * given and the mesher ignores what it does not recognise. So a guess
     * costs nothing *here* and produces a schematic that behaves differently
     * in the game, a long way from anyone who could connect the two.
     *
     * The failure it was built for is quieter than a wrong guess, though. A
     * model that names no properties at all gets a block in its default state,
     * which looks right -- and then whoever opens the inspector to change the
     * direction of that campfire finds a panel with nothing in it, because
     * until `toPlacedEntry` the block was interned bare.
     *
     * ## Why the answer includes `placedAs`
     *
     * It is the question underneath the question. "What properties does a
     * campfire have" is asked in order to find out what will actually be
     * written, and that is one string. It is built by `toPlacedEntry` -- the
     * same function `set_block` uses, not a description of it -- so it cannot
     * drift from what a placement really does.
