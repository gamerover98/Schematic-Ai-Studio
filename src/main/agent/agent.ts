/**
 * The agent loop: one user request, one transaction, however many tool calls.
 *
 * This is the change the plan is really about. Generation used to be a single
 * completion whose text was parsed for a `<code>` block — the model could
 * describe a structure and nothing else, and could not see, measure or modify
 * anything. Here it works against the open document through `agent/tools.ts`,
 * in a loop, and what it does is an ordinary editor transaction.
 *
 * ## One request is one undo
 *
 * The whole run sits inside `runTransactionAsync`, so five hundred blocks
 * across nine tool calls is one CTRL+Z. It also means a run that throws leaves
 * the document exactly as it was, rather than half-edited — the rollback is the
 * transaction's, not something this file has to remember to do.
 *
 * ## Context is resolved, not dumped
 *
 * The schematic never goes to the model. It gets its dimensions, the twenty
 * commonest blocks, and the selection; everything else it has to ask for. A
 * 100x100x100 build is a million cells, and no useful amount of it fits in a
 * prompt — but almost every request only needs a corner of it.
 *
 * ## The conversation is remembered, the schematic is not
 *
 * Prior turns — the user's words, the tool calls, their results — are passed in
 * and replayed, so "now make it taller" knows what "it" is. They are passed
 * rather than read off the session because the conversation outlives it: it is
 * saved per schematic and restored when that file is opened again, which is
 * `services/conversation.ts`'s job, not this file's. What is *not* replayed is
 * the description of the schematic: it is regenerated into
 * the instructions on every turn instead of being prepended to each user
 * message. A transcript of stale descriptions is worse than none, because the
 * model has no way to tell which of five conflicting block counts is current.
 * This way there is exactly one, it is always the live one, and the history
 * holds only what was said.
