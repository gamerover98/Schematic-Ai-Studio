<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Typechecks and builds the Schematic AI Studio Electron app, optionally packaging it.

.DESCRIPTION
    Runs `npm run build` (typecheck + electron-vite build), producing
    out/main, out/preload and out/renderer.

    With -Package, continues into electron-builder to produce a distributable in
    release/. electron-builder is invoked directly rather than through the
    `package:*` npm scripts, because those re-run the build that just finished.

    The app has no native dependencies, so no rebuild step is needed for any
    target.

.PARAMETER Package
    Optional distribution target: win, linux or mac. Cross-building is subject
    to electron-builder's own platform limitations (notably, mac targets
    generally require macOS).

    .\scripts\build.ps1
