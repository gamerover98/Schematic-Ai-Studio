# Typechecks and builds the Schematic AI Studio Electron app, optionally packaging it.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build.sh                 # typecheck + build into out/
#   scripts/build.sh --package linux # ...then package into release/
#
# --package accepts win, linux or mac. electron-builder is invoked directly
# rather than through the package:* npm scripts, because those re-run the build
# that just finished. Cross-building is subject to electron-builder's own
# platform limitations (notably, mac targets generally require macOS).
#
# The app has no native dependencies, so no rebuild step is needed for any
# target.
